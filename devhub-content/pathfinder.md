# What is Pathfinder 

Technology is moving faster than ever and it’s not showing any signs of slowing down. As an ongoing OCIO initiative, Pathfinder projects are testbeds for government to explore the potential of these emerging technology solutions, and to be ready to capture the benefits. They deliver business value through a “learn by doing” process, matching known business problems with these emerging technologies. What is learned is shared, so other projects have a path to follow. To facilitate speed and innovation, Pathfinder projects are provided greater latitude when adhering to existing standards with the understanding that the learning gathered will inform any necessary standards/revisions going forward.
