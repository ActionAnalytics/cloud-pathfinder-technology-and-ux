# Overview of Slack (Chat)

## Description
Slack offers many IRC-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. Content, including files, conversations, and people, is all searchable within Slack. Users can add emoji buttons to their messages, on which other users can then click to express their reactions to messages. Slack's free plan allows only the 10,000 most recent messages to be viewed and searched.
