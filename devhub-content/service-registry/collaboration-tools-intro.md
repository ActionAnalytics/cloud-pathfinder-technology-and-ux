# Introduction

This DevHub Topic provides a listing some online tools that may be useful for BC Government teams who have found themselves needing to evaluate technology options to support remote work within and across organizations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This listing includes the set of standard tools available to all government employees, as well as others that teams may wish to consider in cases where the standard tools are not suitable.

##  Tool Categories

Collaboration tools that teams may want to leverage fall into different, but sometimes overlapping categories.  Below is a summary of the categories that have been used for the purposes of this tools listing.

###  Group/Team Chat
Group/Team Chat tools provide a means for multiple users to communicate amongst themselves. Tools will typically provide facilities to create "channels" or similar concepts to discuss specific topics, or to have discussions involving only certain team members.  Group/Team Chat tools primarily support text-based communication, but most include other capabilities such as link/file sharing and some include voice or video calling, blurring the distinction with Conference tools.  Unlike Conference tools, Group/Team Chat tools are "always on" - there is no concept of scheduling a time slot to have a chat. Group/Team Chat tools typically also support "apps" or "integrations" to add additional capabilities and connections to other other services.  For example, some teams connect their Task Management tool with their Group/Team Chat tool so they get a notice in a channel when a work item is completed.  Chat tools typically provide means to participate from a web browser, as well as dedicated desktop and mobile applications. 

### Conference
Conference tools focus on real-time voice and video communication between individuals, teams, or in some cases, large groups of people.  Conference tools typically provide mechanisms for users to join sessions via desktop or mobile apps, as well as standard telephone lines.  Conference tools include screen sharing capabilities, and most have some form of chat functionality, although this is not as sophisticated as what is found in Group/Team Chat tools.  Conference tools generally require setting up a time slot for a session to occur, and tools also provide for inviting one or more users.  Conference tools may be integrated with calendaring functions in tools such as Microsoft Exchange.  Some conference tools provide for "webinar" functionality in which a large number of users may be able to view presentations/broadcast from one or more individuals and participate in a moderated fashion. Conference tools typically require participant to install a dedicated desktop or mobile application in order to use all functionality; most provide for audio-only via standard phone number without an app.
